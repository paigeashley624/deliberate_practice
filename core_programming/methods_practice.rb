# 1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word with all capital letters.

# puts "Please enter a word"
# word = gets.chomp 

# puts word.upcase

# 2. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a big number" if the number is greater than 100.
# puts "Enter a number"
# num = gets.chomp.to_i

# if num > 100
#   print "thats a big number you got there buddy!"
# end

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.

# puts "Enter two numbers:"
# num1 = gets.chomp.to_i
# num2 = gets.chomp.to_i

# puts "Your two numbers equal #{num1 + num2}"

# 4. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word in reverse order.

# puts "Enter a word:"
# p word = gets.chomp.reverse.capitalize

# 5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints the number times 10.

# puts "Enter a number:"
# num = gets.chomp

# 10.times {puts num}

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.
# puts "Enter a word:"
# word1 = gets.chomp
# puts "..and another one"
# word2 = gets.chomp 

# puts "#{word1} #{word2}".upcase


# 7. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints the number of letters in the word.
# puts "Enter a word:"
# word = gets.chomp

# p word.length

# 8. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a negative number" if the number is less than 0.

# puts "Enter a number"
# num = gets.chomp.to_i 

# if num < 0
#   puts "Thats a negative number"
# end

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the two numbers multiplied together.

# puts "Enter a number:"
# num = gets.chomp.to_i
# puts "Enter another number:"
# num2 = gets.chomp.to_i

# p num * num2 

# 10. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints "That's a long word" if the word has more than 5 letters.

# puts "Enter a word:"
# word = gets.chomp 

# if word.length > 5 
#   puts "thats a long word"
# end
